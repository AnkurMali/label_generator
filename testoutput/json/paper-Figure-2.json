After a transient time, the velocity field changes continually and periodically. Figure (a) shows a vortex that has just formed behind the cylinder, rotating in the counterclockwise direction. It then moves away to the right. Some time later, another vortex is formed behind the cylinder, rotating in the clockwise direction, figure (b). Later, figure (c), the velocity field returns to the configuration observed in figure (a). The whole process is periodically repeated. At this fine scale near the cylinder back side, the same behavior is observed in the case of a fixed cylinder. However, behind this region there is a long von Ka\u0301rma\u0301n street of vortices, now bended downwards in this slowly rotating case here considered.
